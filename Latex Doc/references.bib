@ARTICLE{1,
  title     = "2022 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures",
  abstract  = "This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's
               disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality and
               morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on
               family caregivers, the dementia workforce and society. The
               Special Report discusses consumers' and primary care physicians'
               perspectives on awareness, diagnosis and treatment of mild
               cognitive impairment (MCI), including MCI due to Alzheimer's
               disease. An estimated 6.5 million Americans age 65 and older are
               living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow
               to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical
               breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death
               certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, the latest
               year for which data are available. Alzheimer's disease was
               officially listed as the sixth-leading cause of death in the
               United States in 2019 and the seventh-leading cause of death in
               2020 and 2021, when COVID-19 entered the ranks of the top ten
               causes of death. Alzheimer's remains the fifth-leading cause of
               death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019,
               deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas
               reported deaths from AD increased more than 145\%. More than 11
               million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an
               estimated 16 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or
               other dementias in 2021. These figures reflect a decline in the
               number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as
               an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining
               caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $271.6
               billion in 2021. Its costs, however, extend to family
               caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative
               mental and physical health outcomes - costs that have been
               aggravated by COVID-19. Members of the dementia care workforce
               have also been affected by COVID-19. As essential care workers,
               some have opted to change jobs to protect their own health and
               the health of their families. However, this occurs at a time
               when more members of the dementia care workforce are needed.
               Average per-person Medicare payments for services to
               beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are
               almost three times as great as payments for beneficiaries
               without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 22
               times as great. Total payments in 2022 for health care,
               long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older
               with dementia are estimated to be $321 billion. A recent survey
               commissioned by the Alzheimer's Association revealed several
               barriers to consumers' understanding of MCI. The survey showed
               low awareness of MCI among Americans, a reluctance among
               Americans to see their doctor after noticing MCI symptoms, and
               persistent challenges for primary care physicians in diagnosing
               MCI. Survey results indicate the need to improve MCI awareness
               and diagnosis, especially in underserved communities, and to
               encourage greater participation in MCI-related clinical trials.",

@ARTICLE{2,
  title    = "The price of progress: Funding and financing Alzheimer's disease
              drug development",
  author   = "Cummings, Jeffrey and Reiber, Carl and Kumar, Parvesh",
  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Advancing research and treatment for Alzheimer's
              disease (AD) and the search for effective treatments depend on a
              complex financial ecosystem involving federal, state, industry,
              advocacy, venture capital, and philanthropy funding approaches.
              METHODS: We conducted an expert review of the literature
              pertaining to funding and financing of translational research and
              drug development for AD. RESULTS: The federal government is the
              largest public funder of research in AD. The National Institute
              on Aging, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute
              of General Medical Sciences, and National Center for Advancing
              Translational Science all fund aspects of research in AD drug
              development. Non-National Institutes of Health federal funding
              comes from the National Science Foundation, Veterans
              Administration, Food and Drug Administration, and the Center for
              Medicare and Medicaid Services. Academic Medical Centers host
              much of the federally funded basic science research and are
              increasingly involved in drug development. Funding of the
              ``Valley of Death'' involves philanthropy and federal funding
              through small business programs and private equity from seed
              capital, angel investors, and venture capital companies. Advocacy
              groups fund both basic science and clinical trials. The Alzheimer
              Association is the advocacy organization with the largest
              research support portfolio relevant to AD drug development.
              Pharmaceutical companies are the largest supporters of biomedical
              research worldwide; companies are most interested in late stage
              de-risked drugs. Drugs progressing into phase II and III are
              candidates for pharmaceutical industry support through licensing,
              mergers and acquisitions, and co-development collaborations.
              DISCUSSION: Together, the funding and financing entities involved
              in supporting AD drug development comprise a complex,
              interactive, dynamic financial ecosystem. Funding source
              interaction is largely unstructured and available funding is
              insufficient to meet all demands for new therapies. Novel
              approaches to funding such as mega-funds have been proposed and
              more integration of component parts would assist in accelerating
              drug development.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: An increase in lifespan in our society is a
               double-edged sword that entails a growing number of patients
               with neurocognitive disorders, Alzheimer's disease being the
               most prevalent. Advances in medical imaging and computational
               power enable new methods for the early detection of
               neurocognitive disorders with the goal of preventing or reducing
               cognitive decline. Computer-aided image analysis and early
               detection of changes in cognition is a promising approach for
               patients with mild cognitive impairment, sometimes a prodromal
               stage of Alzheimer's disease dementia. METHODS: We conducted a
               systematic review following PRISMA guidelines of studies where
               machine learning was applied to neuroimaging data in order to
               predict whether patients with mild cognitive impairment might
               develop Alzheimer's disease dementia or remain stable. After
               removing duplicates, we screened 452 studies and selected 116
               for qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Most studies used magnetic
               resonance image (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET)
               data but also magnetoencephalography. The datasets were mainly
               extracted from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative
               (ADNI) database with some exceptions. Regarding the algorithms
               used, the most common was support vector machine with a mean
               accuracy of 75.4\%, but convolutional neural networks achieved a
               higher mean accuracy of 78.5\%. Studies combining MRI and PET
               achieved overall better classification accuracy than studies
               that only used one neuroimaging technique. In general, the more
               complex models such as those based on deep learning, combined
               with multimodal and multidimensional data (neuroimaging,
               clinical, cognitive, genetic, and behavioral) achieved the best
               performance. CONCLUSIONS: Although the performance of the
               different methods still has room for improvement, the results
               are promising and this methodology has a great potential as a
               support tool for clinicians and healthcare professionals.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of
               dementia, a syndrome characterized by cognitive impairment
               severe enough to interfere with activities of daily life. We
               aimed to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of studies
               that applied machine learning (ML) methods to clinical data
               derived from electronic health records in order to model risk
               for progression of AD dementia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
               searched for articles published between January 1, 2010, and May
               31, 2020, in PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE Explore Digital
               Library, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library,
               and arXiv. We used predefined criteria to select relevant
               articles and summarized them according to key components of ML
               analysis such as data characteristics, computational algorithms,
               and research focus. RESULTS: There has been a considerable rise
               over the past 5 years in the number of research papers using
               ML-based analysis for AD dementia modeling. We reviewed 64
               relevant articles in our SLR. The results suggest that majority
               of existing research has focused on predicting progression of AD
               dementia using publicly available datasets containing both
               neuroimaging and clinical data (neurobehavioral status exam
               scores, patient demographics, neuroimaging data, and laboratory
               test values). DISCUSSION: Identifying individuals at risk for
               progression of AD dementia could potentially help to personalize
               disease management to plan future care. Clinical data consisting
               of both structured data tables and clinical notes can be
               effectively used in ML-based approaches to model risk for AD
               dementia progression. Data sharing and reproducibility of
               results can enhance the impact, adaptation, and generalizability
               of this research.",

               and prognostic prediction using neuroimaging data",
  author    = "Jo, Taeho and Nho, Kwangsik and Saykin, Andrew J",
  abstract  = "Deep learning, a state-of-the-art machine learning approach, has
               shown outstanding performance over traditional machine learning
               in identifying intricate structures in complex high-dimensional
               data, especially in the domain of computer vision. The
               application of deep learning to early detection and automated
               classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained
               considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging
               techniques has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging
               data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning
               approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification
               of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used
               to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January
               2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and
               classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings
               were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria,
               4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine
               learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches.
               The combination of traditional machine learning for
               classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature
               selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8\% for AD
               classification and 83.7\% for prediction of conversion from mild
               cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep
               learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN)
               or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data
               without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded
               accuracies of up to 96.0\% for AD classification and 84.2\% for
               MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance
               was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers
               were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in
               performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic
               classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD
               research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving
               performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such
               as-omics data, increasing transparency with explainable
               approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related

               imaging, as well as clinical features impose great challenges in
               data integration and analysis. Machine learning (ML) methods
               offer novel techniques to address high dimensional data,
               integrate data from different sources, model the etiological and
               clinical heterogeneity, and discover new biomarkers. These
               directions have the potential to help us better manage the
               disease progression and develop novel treatment strategies. This
               mini-review paper summarizes different ML methods that have been
               applied to study AD using single-platform or multi-modal data.
               We review the current state of ML applications for five key
               directions of AD research: disease classification, drug
               repurposing, subtyping, progression prediction, and biomarker
               discovery. This summary provides insights about the current
               research status of ML-based AD research and highlights potential
               directions for future research.",

  abstract  = "Deep learning, a state-of-the-art machine learning approach, has
               shown outstanding performance over traditional machine learning
               in identifying intricate structures in complex high-dimensional
               data, especially in the domain of computer vision. The
               application of deep learning to early detection and automated
               classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained
               considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging
               techniques has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging
               data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning
               approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification
               of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used
               to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January
               2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and
               classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings
               were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria,
               4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine
               learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches.
               The combination of traditional machine learning for
               classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature
               selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8\% for AD
               classification and 83.7\% for prediction of conversion from mild
               cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep
               learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN)
               or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data
               without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded
               accuracies of up to 96.0\% for AD classification and 84.2\% for
               MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance
               was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers
               were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in
               performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic
               classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD
               research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving
               performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such
               as-omics data, increasing transparency with explainable

               disease (AD), has the potential to improve clinical outcomes
               through early intervention. Recently, Davatzikos et al. (2009)
               supported the hypothesis that pathologic atrophy in AD is an
               accelerated aging process, implying accelerated brain atrophy.
               In order to recognize faster brain atrophy, a model of healthy
               brain aging is needed first. Here, we introduce a framework for
               automatically and efficiently estimating the age of healthy
               subjects from their T(1)-weighted MRI scans using a kernel
               method for regression. This method was tested on over 650
               healthy subjects, aged 19-86 years, and collected from four
               different scanners. Furthermore, the influence of various
               parameters on estimation accuracy was analyzed. Our age
               estimation framework included automatic preprocessing of the
               T(1)-weighted images, dimension reduction via principal
               component analysis, training of a relevance vector machine (RVM;
               Tipping, 2000) for regression, and finally estimating the age of
               the subjects from the test samples. The framework proved to be a
               reliable, scanner-independent, and efficient method for age
               estimation in healthy subjects, yielding a correlation of r=0.92
               between the estimated and the real age in the test samples and a
               mean absolute error of 5 years. The results indicated favorable
               performance of the RVM and identified the number of training
               samples as the critical factor for prediction accuracy. Applying
               the framework to people with mild AD resulted in a mean brain
               age gap estimate (BrainAGE) score of +10 years.",

               insights into the pathophysiology of the disease, for which age
               is the principal risk factor. However, in recent years, a
               multitude of clinical trial failures has led to pharmaceutical
               corporations becoming more and more unwilling to support drug
               development in AD. It is possible that dependence on the amyloid
               cascade hypothesis as a guide for preclinical research and drug
               discovery is part of the problem. Accumulating evidence suggests
               that amyloid plaques and tau tangles are evident in non-demented
               individuals and that reducing or clearing these lesions does not
               always result in clinical improvement. Normal aging is
               associated with pathologies and cognitive decline that are
               similar to those observed in AD, making differentiation of

               cognitive or neuropathological markers that distinguish AD from

  abstract  = "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disorder that causes degeneration
               of the cells in the brain and it is the main cause of dementia,
               which is characterized by a decline in thinking and independence
               in personal daily activities. AD is considered a multifactorial
               disease: two main hypotheses were proposed as a cause for AD,
               cholinergic and amyloid hypotheses. Additionally, several risk
               factors such as increasing age, genetic factors, head injuries,
               vascular diseases, infections, and environmental factors play a
               role in the disease. Currently, there are only two classes of
               approved drugs to treat AD, including inhibitors to
               cholinesterase enzyme and antagonists to N-methyl d-aspartate
               (NMDA), which are effective only in treating the symptoms of AD,
               but do not cure or prevent the disease. Nowadays, the research
               is focusing on understanding AD pathology by targeting several
               mechanisms, such as abnormal tau protein metabolism,
               $\beta$-amyloid, inflammatory response, and cholinergic and free
               radical damage, aiming to develop successful treatments that are
               capable of stopping or modifying the course of AD. This review
               discusses currently available drugs and future theories for the
               development of new therapies for AD, such as disease-modifying

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The objective of this review is to provide
               information for clinicians regarding current research and
               opinions on the association of depression to conditions of
               cognitive impairment and dementia. We also intend to integrate
               this current research and thinking into strategies for the
               assessment and treatment of depression in the context of
               cognitive impairment. REVIEW SUMMARY: Depression is highly
               prevalent in mild cognitive impairment and most dementias. It
               may be a risk factor for the subsequent development of dementia
               and in some conditions may be a prodromal symptom. It is
               important to detect and effectively treat depression because the
               comorbidity of depression and cognitive impairment is associated
               with greater cognitive and functional decline and higher rates
               of institutionalization. Depression often can be differentiated
               from Alzheimer disease and other dementias based on
               characteristics of clinical history and presentation. Screening
               of depression and cognitive impairment will help characterize
               the presence and severity of these conditions, but limitations
               in screening approaches may necessitate comprehensive assessment
               in complex cases where differential diagnosis is important to
               treatment planning. CONCLUSION: Although depression and
               cognitive impairment are important issues in the treatment of
               older adults, there are particular risks when they occur
               together. Appropriate assessment and screening can help guide
               the clinician to appropriate and timely interventions.
               Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment approaches are both
               efficacious in reducing depression in cognitive impairment and
               dementia.",

               in medical image segmentation, as it defines regions of interest

               The extensive investigation of multi-atlas warping and fusion
               techniques over the past 5 or more years has clearly
               demonstrated the advantages of consensus-based segmentation.
               However, the common approach is to use multiple atlases with a
               single registration method and parameter set, which is not
               necessarily optimal for every individual scan, anatomical
               region, and problem/data-type. Different registration criteria
               and parameter sets yield different solutions, each providing
               complementary information. Herein, we present a consensus
               labeling framework that generates a broad ensemble of labeled
               atlases in target image space via the use of several warping
               algorithms, regularization parameters, and atlases. The label
               fusion integrates two complementary sources of information: a
               local similarity ranking to select locally optimal atlases and a
               boundary modulation term to refine the segmentation consistently
               with the target image's intensity profile. The ensemble approach
               consistently outperforms segmentations using individual warping

               datasets. The MUSE methodology has been used for processing

  abstract = 	 {We introduce Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA), a method to learn complex nonlinear transformations of two views of data such that the resulting representations are highly linearly correlated. Parameters of both transformations are jointly learned to maximize the (regularized) total correlation.   It can be viewed as a nonlinear extension of the linear method \emphcanonical correlation analysis (CCA).  It is an alternative to the nonparametric method \emphkernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) for learning correlated nonlinear transformations. Unlike KCCA, DCCA does not require an inner product, and has the advantages of a parametric method: training time scales well with data size and the training data need not be referenced when computing the representations of unseen instances.  In experiments on two real-world datasets, we find that DCCA learns representations with significantly higher correlation than those learned by CCA and KCCA. We also introduce a novel non-saturating sigmoid function based on the cube root that may be useful more generally in feedforward neural networks.}

                   simplest to implement and parallelize. It consists of
                   computing gradients of a smoothed approximation of the
                   objective function (and constraints), and employing them
                   within established codes. These gradient approximations are
                   calculated by finite differences, with a differencing
                   interval determined by the noise level in the functions and
                   a bound on the second or third derivatives. It is assumed
                   that noise level is known or can be estimated by means of
                   difference tables or sampling. The use of finite differences
                   has been largely dismissed in the derivative-free

               proposed earlier is analyzed here. It is called projective
               nonnegative matrix factorization (PNMF). The new method
               approximately factorizes a projection matrix, minimizing the
               reconstruction error, into a positive low-rank matrix and its
               transpose. The dissimilarity between the original data matrix
               and its approximation can be measured by the Frobenius matrix
               norm or the modified Kullback-Leibler divergence. Both measures
               are minimized by multiplicative update rules, whose convergence
               is proven for the first time. Enforcing orthonormality to the
               basic objective is shown to lead to an even more efficient
               update rule, which is also readily extended to nonlinear cases.
               The formulation of the PNMF objective is shown to be connected
               to a variety of existing NMF methods and clustering approaches.
               In addition, the derivation using Lagrangian multipliers reveals
               the relation between reconstruction and sparseness. For kernel
               principal component analysis (PCA) with the binary constraint,
               useful in graph partitioning problems, the nonlinear kernel PNMF
               provides a good approximation which outperforms an existing
               discretization approach. Empirical study on three real-world
               databases shows that PNMF can achieve the best or close to the
               best in clustering. The proposed algorithm runs more efficiently
               than the compared NMF methods, especially for high-dimensional
               data. Moreover, contrary to the basic NMF, the trained
               projection matrix can be readily used for newly coming samples

               assumed that X is a matrix of observed data and $\sigma$ is the
               known matrix of standard deviations of elements of X. Both X and
               $\sigma$ are of dimensions n $\times$ m. The method solves the
               bilinear matrix problem X = GF + E where G is the unknown left
               hand factor matrix (scores) of dimensions n $\times$ p, F is the
               unknown right hand factor matrix (loadings) of dimensions p
               $\times$ m, and E is the matrix of residuals. The problem is
               solved in the weighted least squares sense: G and F are
               determined so that the Frobenius norm of E divided
               (element-by-element) by $\sigma$ is minimized. Furthermore, the
               solution is constrained so that all the elements of G and F are
               required to be non-negative. It is shown that the solutions by
               PMF are usually different from any solutions produced by the
               customary factor analysis (FA, i.e. principal component analysis
               (PCA) followed by rotations). Usually PMF produces a better fit
               to the data than FA. Also, the result of PF is guaranteed to be
               non-negative, while the result of FA often cannot be rotated so
               that all negative entries would be eliminated. Different
               possible application areas of the new method are briefly
               discussed. In environmental data, the error estimates of data
               can be widely varying and non-negativity is often an essential
               feature of the underlying models. Thus it is concluded that PMF
               is better suited than FA or PCA in many environmental
               applications. Examples of successful applications of PMF are

               There is psychological and physiological evidence for
               parts-based representations in the brain, and certain
               computational theories of object recognition rely on such
               representations. But little is known about how brains or
               computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate
               an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able
               to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is
               in contrast to other methods, such as principal components
               analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not
               parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization
               is distinguished from the other methods by its use of
               non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a
               parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not
               subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix
               factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based
               representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing

               Factorization (NNMF) for the analysis of structural neuroimaging
               data. The goal is to identify the brain regions that co-vary
               across individuals in a consistent way, hence potentially being
               part of underlying brain networks or otherwise influenced by
               underlying common mechanisms such as genetics and pathologies.
               NNMF offers a directly data-driven way of extracting relatively
               localized co-varying structural regions, thereby transcending
               limitations of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent
               Component Analysis (ICA) and other related methods that tend to
               produce dispersed components of positive and negative loadings.
               In particular, leveraging upon the well known ability of NNMF to
               produce parts-based representations of image data, we derive
               decompositions that partition the brain into regions that vary
               in consistent ways across individuals. Importantly, these

               split-sample experiments. We empirically validate NNMF in two

               study, and ii) a structural Magnetic Resonance (sMR) study of

               sparse parts-based representations of the data at various

               about the underlying functional organization of the brain and
               also capture some pathological processes. Moreover, we show that
               these low dimensional representations favorably compare to

               The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a

               and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression
               show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The
               vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If

               a priori assumptions about the location and extent of the

               RAVENS, for characterizing regional atrophy in the brain. A new
               method for elastic, volume-preserving spatial normalization,
               which allows for accurate quantification of very localized
               atrophy, is used. The RAVENS methodology was tested on images
               with simulated atrophy within two gyri: precentral and superior
               temporal. It was found to accurately determine the regions of
               atrophy, despite their localized nature and the interindividual
               variability of cortical structures. Moreover, it was found to
               perform substantially better than the voxel-based morphology
               method of SPM'99. Improved sensitivity was achieved at the
               expense of human effort involved in defining a number of sulcal

               influence AD pathogenesis via the cerebrovascular system. To
               investigate the role of CBF endophenotypes in AD pathogenesis,

               examine associations between 4033 single-nucleotide
               polymorphisms of 24 AD genes and CBF measures in 4 brain
               regions. A novel association with CBF measure in the left

               these only explain a small proportion of the genetic variance,
               indicating that undiscovered loci remain. Here, we performed a
               large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD
               and AD-by-proxy (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls). AD-by-proxy,
               based on parental diagnoses, showed strong genetic correlation
               with AD (rg = 0.81). Meta-analysis identified 29 risk loci,
               implicating 215 potential causative genes. Associated genes are
               strongly expressed in immune-related tissues and cell types
               (spleen, liver, and microglia). Gene-set analyses indicate
               biological mechanisms involved in lipid-related processes and
               degradation of amyloid precursor proteins. We show strong
               genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and
               Mendelian randomization results suggest a protective effect of
               cognitive ability on AD risk. These results are a step forward

  abstract  = "Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most
               prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify
               LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association
               meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals).
               We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new
               genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of
               which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide
               association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia.
               Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region
               confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype
               HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates
               immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid
               precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic
               variants affecting APP and A$\beta$ processing are associated
               not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease
               but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show
               enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 $\times$ 10-7),
               indicating that additional rare variants remain to be
               identified. We also identify important genetic correlations

               obtained from blood samples is crucial for early AD diagnosis.
               We used three public datasets, ADNI, AddNeuroMed1 (ANM1), and
               ANM2, for this study. Five feature selection methods and five
               classifiers were used to curate AD-related genes and
               discriminate AD patients, respectively. In the internal
               validation (five-fold cross-validation within each dataset), the
               best average values of the area under the curve (AUC) were
               0.657, 0.874, and 0.804 for ADNI, ANMI, and ANM2, respectively.
               In the external validation (training and test sets from
               different datasets), the best AUCs were 0.697 (training: ADNI to
               testing: ANM1), 0.764 (ADNI to ANM2), 0.619 (ANM1 to ADNI), 0.79

               classification performance of ADNI is relatively lower than that
               of ANM1 and ANM2, classifiers trained using blood gene
               expression can be used to classify AD for other data sets. In
               addition, pathway analysis showed that AD-related genes were
               enriched with inflammation, mitochondria, and Wnt signaling
               pathways. Our study suggests that blood gene expression data are

               of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used
               to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January
               2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and
               classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings
               were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria,
               4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine
               learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches.
               The combination of traditional machine learning for
               classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature
               selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8\% for AD
               classification and 83.7\% for prediction of conversion from mild
               cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep
               learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN)
               or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data
               without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded
               accuracies of up to 96.0\% for AD classification and 84.2\% for
               MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance
               was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers
               were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in
               performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic
               classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD
               research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving
               performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such
               as-omics data, increasing transparency with explainable
               approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related
               features and mechanisms.",

  abstract  = "A growing body of evidence currently proposes that deep learning
               approaches can serve as an essential cornerstone for the
               diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In light
               of the latest advancements in neuroimaging and genomics,
               numerous deep learning models are being exploited to distinguish
               AD from normal controls and/or to distinguish AD from mild
               cognitive impairment in recent research studies. In this review,
               we focus on the latest developments for AD prediction using deep
               learning techniques in cooperation with the principles of
               neuroimaging and genomics. First, we narrate various
               investigations that make use of deep learning algorithms to
               establish AD prediction using genomics or neuroimaging data.
               Particularly, we delineate relevant integrative neuroimaging
               genomics investigations that leverage deep learning methods to
               forecast AD on the basis of incorporating both neuroimaging and
               genomics data. Moreover, we outline the limitations as regards
               to the recent AD investigations of deep learning with
               neuroimaging and genomics. Finally, we depict a discussion of
               challenges and directions for future research. The main novelty
               of this work is that we summarize the major points of these
               investigations and scrutinize the similarities and differences
               among these investigations.",

  abstract  = "A long-standing question is how to best use brain morphometric
               and genetic data to distinguish Alzheimer's disease (AD)
               patients from cognitively normal (CN) subjects and to predict
               those who will progress from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to
               AD. Here, we use a neural network (NN) framework on both
               magnetic resonance imaging-derived quantitative structural brain
               measures and genetic data to address this question. We tested
               the effectiveness of NN models in classifying and predicting AD.
               We further performed a novel analysis of the NN model to gain
               insight into the most predictive imaging and genetics features
               and to identify possible interactions between features that
               affect AD risk. Data were obtained from the AD Neuroimaging
               Initiative cohort and included baseline structural MRI data and
               single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for 138 AD patients,
               225 CN subjects, and 358 MCI patients. We found that NN models
               with both brain and SNP features as predictors perform
               significantly better than models with either alone in
               classifying AD and CN subjects, with an area under the receiver
               operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.992, and in predicting
               the progression from MCI to AD (AUC=0.835). The most important
               predictors in the NN model were the left middle temporal gyrus
               volume, the left hippocampus volume, the right entorhinal cortex
               volume, and the APOE (a gene that encodes apolipoprotein E) ɛ4
               risk allele. Furthermore, we identified interactions between the
               right parahippocampal gyrus and the right lateral occipital
               gyrus, the right banks of the superior temporal sulcus and the
               left posterior cingulate, and SNP rs10838725 and the left
               lateral occipital gyrus. Our work shows the ability of NN models
               to not only classify and predict AD occurrence but also to
               identify important AD risk factors and interactions among them.",
