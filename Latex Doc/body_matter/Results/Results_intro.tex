\chapter{\tl{Results} }
\en{In this chapter, we introduce results the methods and combinations thereof we experimented with achieved. 

First, the classification results of the raw views are presented, meaning the imaging data as is (145 ROIs) and the genetic data as is (54 SNPs), as a baseline. Those results are contrasted with the results of applying DCCA to those data. Following that, the classification results using MCA-transformed genetic data (10 genetic components) and the original imaging data are presented, and contrasted with DCCA applied on top of that. Afterwards, the respective results are presented after OPNMF (30 imaging components) and then with DCCA on top of that, using the combination of MCA and OPNMF, and finally after FAMD. 

For the aforementioned combinations of methods, the classification results are presented before and after scaling (if needed) and balancing, to highlight the effect those techniques have on the task. Finally, to ensure that the effect of having both views is properly documented, we perform the same task with both views, as well as keeping only one view, testing imaging and genetic for every method.
